# Jury Service Policy

We would like to enable our employees to perform any public duties that they may be committed to
undertake and so will authorise time off to do so where it does not conflict with the
operational needs of our business. 

This policy does not form part of any employee's contract of employment and we may amend it at any time. 

## JURY SERVICE

1. You should let your line manager know as soon as you are summoned for jury service and if requested,
provide a copy of your summons to a Director.

2. Depending on the demands of our business we may request that you apply to be excused
from or defer your jury service.

3. We are not required by law to pay you while you are absent on jury service. You will be
advised at court of the expenses and loss of earnings that you can claim. However, we will
pay basic pay to employees on jury service, less any amounts you can claim from the court
for lost earnings for up to 5 working days. Time off beyond 5 working days may be paid at our discretion.
