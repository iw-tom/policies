# Flexible Working Policy #

This policy applies to employees of Opus Works only. A flexible working request under this policy means a
request to do any or all of the following:

1. To reduce or vary your working hours;
2. To reduce or vary the days you work;
3. To work from a different location (for example, home)

Your flexible working request should be submitted to your Manager in writing and dated. It should:

1. State that it is a flexible working request;
2. Explain the change being requested and propose a start date;
3. Identify the impact the change would have on the business and how that might be dealt with; and
4. State whether you have made any previous flexible working request.

We will arrange a meeting at a convenient time and place to discuss your request. You may be accompanied at the
meeting by a colleague of your choice. They will be entitled to speak and confer privately with you, but may not
answer questions on your behalf. We may decide to grant your request in full without a meeting, in which case we
will write to you with our decision.

We will inform you in writing of our decision as soon as possible after the meeting. If your request is accepted, we
will write to you with details of the new working arrangements and the date on which they will commence. You
will be asked to sign and return a copy of the letter. If we cannot immediately accept your request we may require
you to undertake a trial period before reaching a final decision on your request. Unless otherwise agreed,
changes to you terms of employment will be permanent. We may reject your request for one or more of the
following business reasons:

1. The burden of additional costs:
2. Detrimental effect on ability to meet client demand;
3. Inability to reorganise work among existing colleagues;
4. Inability to recruit additional colleagues;
5. Detrimental impact on quality;
6. Detrimental impact on performance;
7. Insufficiency of work during the periods that you propose to work; or
8. Planned changes.

If we are unable to agree to your request, we will write to tell you which of those reasons applies in your case.
