# Opus Works Expenses Policy and Receipt Processing

One of the things we’re keen to have in place is an easy, specific, clear expenses policy - one where people raising expenses can understand what they can spend, who approves and validates their expenses claims, and how much they’re going to be paid and by when.

It is extremely important for Opus Works that we process expenses and receipts quickly to allow us to manage the internal accounts properly and promptly and pay you back as quickly as we can.

Additionally, we have been extremely poor at ensuring that VAT receipts are provided in a timely fashion - this has impacted our ability to reclaim VAT effectively. Ultimately we’d much prefer to spend our money on our team than paying unnecessary VAT!

In order to make sure we do this effectively, we have put this guidance together to underline the process.

## Who validates my expenses claim?
A director will approve your expenses claim (with receipts) according to the following spending guidance.

## How do I create a claim?
We have expenses and business mileage spreadsheets for Employees or Contractors to create a claim.   Digital copies of all receipts will also need to be submitted to support each claim.

By default all expenses are reimbursable. 

**When and how will I get paid?**
Your expense claim will be paid once approved. The payment runs at the start of each month to pay expenses accrued in the previous month. 

**What do I need in order for my expense claim to be approved and paid?.**
In all instances a VAT receipt MUST be provided where possible - exceptions to this will be reviewed on a case by case basis and may be escalated to a Director.

A VAT receipt will include the provider’s VAT number and a breakdown of the cost including VAT. Note that some common expenses, e.g. train fares or take away cold drinks are VAT exempt, and many small traders are not VAT registered. It’s always best to ask for a VAT receipt first and accept a non-VAT receipt if that is all that is available.

There are a number of categories of expenses that you will raise, and here’s guidance on what is needed in order to complete and pay your claim quickly.

**When claiming for expenses when entertaining our clients:**
- VAT receipt
- Tag the customer and project, e.g. Mount Green
- Split of clients vs Opus Works people? (e.g. 50% were client attendees)

**For Staff Entertaining:**
- VAT receipt
- Who was there (if >5 people please provide the team name)
- If there are any attendees that are not Opus Works’ Staff - this is Client entertaining.

**For Mileage (to allow us to reclaim VAT):**
- Fuel receipt (doesn’t have to be for that particular journey, but must be within 90 days)
- Diesel or petrol car?
- Engine size?
- Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
- Is it rechargeable to the client? Put to the 
- Postcode to and from
- How many miles?

**For Travel, e.g. Train, Air, Road (though we expect this to be booked with the prior approval of a Director in all but emergency circumstances):**
- Receipt / booking confirmation
- To / From?
- Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
- Is it rechargeable to the client? 

**For Accommodation (though we expect this to be booked with the prior approval of a Director in all but emergency circumstances):**
- Receipt / booking confirmation
- Location stayed
- Number of nights
- Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
- Is it rechargeable to the client? 

For Taxis to client sites:
Receipt or booking confirmation
To / From?
Who was there?
Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
Is it rechargeable to the client? 

_**Please note - travel cannot be claimed from your home to your regular place of business (typically your the Opus Works office)**._

**For Subsistence:**
VAT Receipt
Claim for your own subsistence only.
Tag the customer and project (if necessary)
Is it rechargeable to the client? 

**What can I spend?**
So we’re clear on what our team can spend (and to allow the people who validate and approve expense claims to approve quickly) we have pulled together the following guidance. Please do your best to keep to these (and the spirit of these) - again, we’d prefer to spend money on things that improve our team and people where possible! 

Obviously with all guidance there is a degree of common sense that needs to be applied, e.g. 
we don’t want you to buy a cheap hotel only to spend a fortune on taxis
we don’t want you walking through dodgy areas to get to a hotel that’s £10 cheaper.

Book things like you would if it was your money, as not to be wasteful whilst taking the same care and consideration for your safety that you would at home.

**Spending limits**

- Subsistence (Food and Drink)
  * Overnight Stay. Up to £40 including breakfast (£25 if breakfast is included with your hotel booking) per overnight stay, supported by receipts (not a flat rate payment)
  * Day travel to temporary workplace £10 supported by receipts, public transport where possible/reasonable e.g. in central London
 
- Hotels (If admin don’t book)
  * UK - Staying outside of London up to £100/night
  * UK - Staying in London up to £200/night
  * Overseas
    * Director approval required for non-client billable bookings
    * Director approval required for client billable bookings. 

- Rail Travel - Standard class unless agreed by a Director (for billable travel) and approval granted prior to travel (for non-billable travel). Advance tickets are often cheaper and also more convenient as they offer a ‘print at home’ or mobile option.

- Air Travel - Economy class unless agreed by Director (for billable travel) and approval granted prior to travel (for non-billable travel).  Advance tickets are substantially cheaper so help us by getting bookings in as early as possible.

- Taxis - We will support expenses for client meetings, and on occasions where people are working late or commuting late to ensure that people get home safely and quickly.  (Sorry, work nights out do not come under this category unless otherwise agreed in advance!)

- Staff entertaining - only if pre-approved by a Director.

Whilst we do not skimp on buying appropriate accessories and IT kit, we expect these things (in all but an emergency) to be purchased via the Directors. This also goes for office equipment, software, licenses etc. Please do not purchase these independently, as it makes it incredibly difficult for us to manage renewals etc. We always do our best to get those purchased as quickly as possible on your behalf.
