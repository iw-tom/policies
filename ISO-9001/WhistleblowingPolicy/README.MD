# Whistleblowing

We are committed to conducting our business with honesty and integrity and we expect all Opus Works
colleagues to maintain high standards. However we want to ensure that if there is any wrong doing that it is
identified and stopped before it negatively impacts on the business, the people within it or anyone else. Any
suspected wrong doing should be reported as soon as possible. This policy covers all employees, directors and
contractors.

Whistleblowing is the reporting of suspected wrongdoing or dangers in relation to our activities. This includes
bribery, fraud or other criminal activity, miscarriages of justice, health and safety risks, damage to the environment
and any breach of legal or professional obligations.

## How to raise a concern
We hope that in many cases you will be able to raise any concerns with your Manager. However, where you prefer
not to raise it with your Manager for any reason, you should contact a Director.

We will arrange a meeting with you as soon as possible to discuss your concern. You may bring a colleague to any
meetings under this policy. Your companion must respect the confidentiality of your disclosure or any subsequent
investigation. We hope that you will feel able to voice whistleblowing concerns openly under this policy.
Completely anonymous disclosures are difficult to investigate. If you want to raise your concern confidentially we
will make every effort to keep your identity secret and only reveal it where necessary to those involved in
investigating your concern.

The aim of this policy is to provide an internal mechanism for reporting, investigating and remedying any wrong
doing in the workplace. In most cases you should not find it necessary to alert anyone externally. The law does
however recognise that in some circumstances it may be appropriate for you to report your concerns to an
external body such as a regulator. We strongly encourage you to seek advice before reporting a concern to anyone
external. Public Concern at Work operates a confidential helpline in this regard 0207 4046609 (email:
whistle@pcaw.co.uk)

Whistleblowers must not suffer any detrimental treatment as a result of raising a genuine concern and any
colleague who threatens or retaliates against them may be subject to disciplinary action. However, if we conclude
that a whistleblower has made false allegations maliciously or with a view to personal gain, the whistleblower may
be subject to disciplinary action.
