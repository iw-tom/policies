# Gifts and Hospitality #

This policy does not prohibit the giving or accepting of reasonable and appropriate hospitality for
legitimate purposes such as building relationships, maintaining our image or reputation, or marketing our
services.

A gift or hospitality will not be appropriate if it is unduly lavish or extravagant, or could be seen as an
inducement or reward for any preferential treatment (for example during contract negotiations or a tender
process).

Gifts must be of an appropriate type and value depending on the circumstances and taking account of the
reason for the gift. Gifts must not include cash or cash equivalent (such as vouchers) or be given in
secret. Gifts must be given in our name, not your name.

You must declare to the Admin Team (and keep a written record) of all hospitality or gifts given or
received. You must also submit all expenses claims relating to hospitality, gifts or payments to third
parties in accordance with our expenses policy and record the reason for expenditure.

## How to raise a concern ##

If you are offered a bribe or are asked to make one, or if you suspect that any bribery, corruption or other
breach of this policy has occurred or may occur, please notify your Account Manager or the [People Team](mailto:people@infinityworks.com)
as soon as possible.
