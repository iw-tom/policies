# Change Management

## 1. Overview
Change management refers to a formal process for making changes to IT services. The
goal of change management is to increase awareness and understanding of proposed
changes across an organisation and ensure that all changes are made in a thoughtful
way that minimise negative impact to services and customers. This Change Management Process 
should be followed when there isn't an agreed Change Management Process in place and 
documented by a Master Services Agreement (MSA).

## 2. Purpose
Change management generally includes the following steps:
- Planning: Plan the change, including the implementation design, scheduling,
communication plan, testing plan and roll-back plan.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the change, including determining the priority level of the
service and the risk of the proposed change; determine the change type and the
change process to use.
- Review: Review Change Plan with peers and/or Change Advisory Board as
appropriate to the change type.
- Approval: Obtain approval of the Change Plan by management as needed.
- Communication: Communicate about changes with the appropriate parties.
- Implementation: Implement the change.
- Documentation: Document the change and any review and approval
information.
- Post-change review: Review the change with an eye to future improvements.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all changes to IT services provided by Infinity Works to its clients,
where there isn’t an agreed Change Management process in place and documented via
a Master Services Agreement, i.e. the client doesn’t have a standardised change
process.

## 4. Policy
All changes to IT services provided by Infinity Works to its clients must follow a standard
process to ensure appropriate planning and execution. Where a Master Services
Agreement between Infinity Works and a Client does not provide the provision for
Change Management, it is advised to introduce Appendix A.
