# Change Management

## 1. Overview
Change management refers to a formal process for making changes services an agreed scope, budget and delivery date. The
goal of change management is to increase awareness and understanding of proposed
changes across an organisation and ensure that all changes are made in a thoughtful
way that minimise negative impact to services and customers. This Change Management Process 
should be followed when there isn't an agreed Change Management Process in place and 
documented by a Master Services Agreement (MSA).

## 2. Purpose
Change management generally includes the following steps:
- Planning: Document the changes required.
- Evaluation/Review: Evaluate the change, what's its priority, what isn't going to be done or could be delayed - review with peers.
- Approval: Obtain approval of the Change Plan by management as needed.
- Communication: Communicate about changes with the appropriate parties.
- Implementation: Implement the change.
- Documentation: Document the change and any review and approval
information.
- Post-change review: Review the change with an eye to future improvements.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to all changes to services provided by Opus Works to its clients,
where there isn’t an agreed Change Management process in place and documented via
a Master Services Agreement, i.e. the client doesn’t have a standardised change
process.

## 4. Policy
All changes to services provided by Opus Works to its clients must follow a standard
process to ensure appropriate planning and execution. Where a Master Services
Agreement between Opus Works and a Client does not provide the provision for
Change Management, it is advised to introduce Appendix A.
