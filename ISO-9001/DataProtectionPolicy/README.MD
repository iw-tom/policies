# Data Protection Policy
During the course of our activities we will process personal data (which may be held on paper, electronically, or otherwise) about our Opus Works colleagues and we recognise the need to treat it in an appropriate and lawful manner, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA).  The purpose of this policy is to make you aware of how we will handle your personal data.  
## Data Protection Principles
We will comply with the eight data protection principles in the DPA, which say that personal data must be: 
Processed fairly and lawfully; 
Processed for limited purposes and in an appropriate way; 
Adequate, relevant and not excessive for the purpose; 
Accurate; 
Not kept longer than necessary for the purpose; 
Processed in line with individuals’ rights; 
Secure; 
Not transferred to people or organisations situated in countries without adequate protection.  
“Personal Data” means recorded information we hold about you from which you can be identified.  It may include contact details, other personal information, photographs, expressions of opinion about you or indications as to our intentions about you.  “Processing” means doing anything with the data, such as accessing, disclosing, destroying or using the data in any way. 
## Fair and lawful processing
We will usually only process your personal data where you have given your consent or where the processing is necessary to comply with our legal obligation.  In other cases, processing may be necessary for the protection of your vital interests, for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others.  The full list of conditions is set out in the DPA.  
We will only process “sensitive personal data” about ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, health, sex orientation, criminal proceedings or convictions, where a further condition is also met.  Usually this will mean that you have given your explicit consent, or that the processing is legally required for employment purposes.  The full list of conditions is set out in the DPA. 
## How are we likely to use your personal data
We will only process your personal data for the specific purpose or purposes notified to you or for any other purposes specifically permitted by the DPA.  We will process data about Opus Works colleagues for legal, personnel, administrative and management purposes and to enable us to meet our legal obligations as an employer, for example to pay you, monitor your performance and to confer benefits in connection with your employment.  We may process sensitive personal data relating to Opus Works colleagues including, as appropriate: 
Information about an employee’s physical or mental health or condition in order to monitor sick leave and take decisions as o the employee’s fitness for work; 
The employee’s racial or ethnic origin or religious or similar information in order to monitor compliance with equal opportunities legislation; 
In order to comply with legal requirements and obligations to third parties. 
Your personal data will only be processed to the extent it is necessary for the specific purposes notified to you. 
## Data Retention
We will not keep your personal data for longer than it is necessary for the purpose.  This means data will be destroyed or erased from our systems when it is no longer required, or when it is inaccurate or out of date. 
## Processing in line with your rights
You have the right to: 
Request access to any personal data we hold about you; 
Ask to have inaccurate data held about you amended; 
Prevent processing that is likely to cause unwarranted substantial damage or distress to you or anyone else; 
Object to any decision that significantly affects you being taken solely by a computer or other automated process. 
Data Security
We will ensure that appropriate measures are taken against unlawful or unauthorised processing of personal data, and against the accidental loss of, or damage to, personal data.   We have in place procedures to maintain the security of all personal data from the point of collection to the point of destruction.  We will only transfer personal data to a third party if he agrees to comply with those procedures, or if he puts in place adequate measures himself.  Maintaining data security means guaranteeing the confidentiality, integrity and availability (for authorised purposes) of the personal data. 
We will not disclose your personal data to a third party without your consent unless we are satisfied that they are legally entitled to the data.  Where we do disclose your personal data to a third party, we will have regard to the 8 data protection principles.  
## Subject access requests
If you wish to know what personal data we hold about you, you must make the request in writing.  All such written requests should be emailed to a Director.
Breaches of this policy
If you consider that this policy has not been followed in respect of personal data about yourself or others you should raise the matter with a Director.  Any breach of this policy will be taken seriously and may result in disciplinary action.
