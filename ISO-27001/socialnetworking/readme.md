# Social Networking Policy

This policy is in place to minimise the risks to our business through the use of social media.  The policy deals with the use of all forms of social media, including Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter, Google+, Wikipedia and all other social networking sites, internet postings and blogs.   It applies to the use of social media for business purposes as well as personal use that may affect our business in any way.   


### Personal Conduct
Occasional use of social media during working hours is permitted so long as it does not involve unprofessional or inappropriate content, does not interfere with your employment responsibilities or productivity and complies with this policy.  
You must not, however, make any social media communications that could damage our business interests or reputation, even indirectly.  You must not use social media to defame or disparage us, your Opus Works colleagues or any third party; to harass, bully or unlawfully discriminate against colleagues or third parties; to make false or misleading statements; or to impersonate colleagues or third parties.   You must not express opinions on our behalf via social media, unless expressly authorised by your Manager.  You must not post comments about sensitive business related topics, such as our performance, or do anything to jeopardise our confidential information and intellectual property. 


### Security and identity theft

1. Employees should be aware that social networking websites are a public forum, particularly if the employee is part of a "network". Employees should not assume that their entries on any website will remain private.

1. Employees should never send abusive or defamatory messages or images.

1. Employees must also be security conscious and should take steps to protect themselves from identity theft, for example by restricting the amount of personal information that they share on social networking sites. In addition, employees should:

1. Ensure that no information is made available that could provide a person with unauthorised access to Opus Works Consulting and/or any confidential information.

1. Employeeâ€™s should be mindful that the posting of photographs taken at work may include confidential information e.g. computer screens, notice boards etc in the background

1. Refrain from recording any confidential information regarding Opus Works Consulting on any social networking website including pages on these sites for Opus Works Consulting
 

### Disiplinary Action
Any misuse of social media should be reported to your Manager. Breach of this policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.  You may be required to remove any social media content that we consider to constitute a breach of this policy.  Failure to comply with such a request may itself result in disciplinary action.
