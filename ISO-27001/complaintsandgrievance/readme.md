# Complaints and Grievance Policy

## Overview

This procedure explains what employees should do if they have a grievance, including if they feel they are being bullied, harassed or victimised, and how Opus Works will deal with such issues. 

## Purpose

We want Opus Works to be a great place to work and aim to create a positive work environment.  If you have a grievance about something or someone at Opus Works you should let us know and weâ€™ll try to solve it as soon as we can.  Most grievances can be resolved quickly and informally though discussion with your Manager.  However, if this does not resolve the problem you may initiate the formal procedure set out here.

## Scope

This procedure applies to all employees, regardless of length of service, role or seniority.  It does not apply to contractors. 

## Policy

1.	Written Grievance

    You should put your grievance in writing and submit it to your Manager.  If your grievance concerns your Manager you may submit it to the Operations Manager.  The written grievance should set out the nature of the complaint, including any relevant facts, dates and names of the individuals involved so that we can investigate it. 

1.	Meeting 
 
    We will arrange a grievance meeting following receipt of your written grievance.  You should make every effort to attend.  You may bring a colleague to the meeting provided you make a reasonable request in advance and tell us the name of your colleague.  Your colleague will be allowed reasonable paid time off from duties to act as your companion.  If you or your colleague cannot attend at the time specified you should let us know as soon as possible and we will try, within reason, to agree an alternative time.  We may adjourn the meeting if we need to carry out further investigations, after which the meeting will usually be reconvened.  

    We will write to you to confirm our decision and notify you of any further action that we intend to take to resolve the grievance.  We will also advise you of your right of appeal. 

1.	Appeals

    If the grievance has not been resolved to your satisfaction you may appeal in writing to your Manager, stating your full grounds of appeal, within one week of the date on which the decision was sent or given to you. 

    We will hold an appeal meeting, normally within two weeks of receiving the appeal.  This will be dealt with impartially by a Manager who has not previously been involved in the case.  You will have a right to bring a colleague. 

    We will confirm our final decision in writing, usually within one week of the appeal hearing.  There is no further right of appeal.
