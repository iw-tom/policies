# Remote Access and Mobile Policy

## Overview
Remote access to our corporate network is essential to maintain our Team’s productivity, but in many cases this remote access originates from networks that may already be compromised or are at a significantly lower security posture than our corporate network.  While these remote networks are beyond the control of Opus Works policy, we must mitigate these external risks the best of our ability.

## Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to define rules and requirements for connecting to Opus Works network from any host. These rules and requirements are designed to minimize the potential exposure to Opus Works from damages which may result from unauthorized use of Opus Works resources. Damages include the loss of sensitive or company confidential data, intellectual property, damage to public image, damage to critical Opus Works internal systems, and fines or other financial liabilities incurred as a result of those losses.

## Scope
This policy applies to all Opus Works employees, contractors, vendors and agents with a Opus Works owned or personally-owned computer or workstation used to connect to the Opus Works network. This policy applies to remote access connections used to do work on behalf of Opus Works, including reading or sending email and viewing intranet web resources.  This policy covers any and all technical implementations of remote access used to connect to Opus Works networks.

## Policy
It is the responsibility of Opus Works employees, contractors, vendors and agents with remote access privileges to Opus Works corporate network to ensure that their remote access connection is given the same consideration as the user's on-site connection to Opus Works. 

General access to the Internet for recreational use through the Opus Works network is strictly limited to Opus Works employees, contractors, vendors and agents (hereafter referred to as “Authorized Users”).  When accessing the Opus Works network from a personal computer, Authorized Users are responsible for preventing access to any Opus Works computer resources or data by non-Authorized Users.  Performance of illegal activities through the Opus Works network by any user (Authorized or otherwise) is prohibited.  The Authorized User bears responsibility for and consequences of misuse of the Authorized User’s access.  For further information and definitions, see the Acceptable Use Policy.

Authorized Users will not use Opus Works networks to access the Internet for outside business interests.
