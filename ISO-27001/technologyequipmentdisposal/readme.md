- No computer or technology equipment may be sold to any individual other than through the processes identified in this policy (Employee Purchase of Disposed Equipment, see section below).
- No computer equipment should be disposed of via skips, dumps, landfill etc.  Electronic recycling bins may be periodically placed in locations around Opus Works Group.  These can be used to dispose of equipment.  The Systems Manager will properly remove all data prior to final disposal. 
- All electronic drives must be degaussed or overwritten with a commercially available disk cleaning program. Hard drives may also be removed and rendered unreadable (drilling, crushing or other demolition methods).
