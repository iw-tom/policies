# Access Control Policy

## Purpose

Access to data / services used by Opus Works is tightly controlled via a number of methods below.

Data and services includes, but is not limited to:

- Document and file repositories (e.g. Google Drive)
- Collaborative tools (e.g. Confluence)
- Delivery Tracking Tools / Agile Life-cycle Management Tools (e.g. JIRA)
- Cloud Services (e.g. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform)

Client-provided services are exempt from this policy, although all Opus Works staff and contractors must comply with the customer's Access Control Policy.

## Scope

This policy applies to all Opus Works employees and contractors.

## Policy

### User Access Management

The administrators of each system are responsible for allocating and authorising user access rights to that system.

Privileges are allocated on a need-to-use and event-by-event basis and can be initiated via email or Slack.

The ISMS Comittee periodically reviews system access for all internal systems to check:
 - That users have been deactivated or removed as appropriate.
 - Unauthorised privileges have not been obtained.

### User Responsibilities

- Adhere to the [Password Policy](../password/readme.md)
- Adhere to the [Laptop Policy](../laptop/readme.md)
- Adhere to the [Information Sensitivity Policy](../informationsensitivity/readme.md)

### Secure log-on

- We only use systems which require authentication and follow best practice for authentication.
- Wherever possible, Google Authentication is used to simplify account management.
- Multi-factor authentication is required for Google, GitHub and AWS accounts, and is recommended for use wherever possible

### Network Access Control

- Opus Works considers all networks to be untrustworthy.
   - Opus Works does not operate a trusted network (intranet) in order to control access to services.
   - Access control is provided by mechanisms which can operate on untrusted networks.

## Policy Compliance

### Compliance Measurement

The [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee) will verify compliance to this policy through various methods, including but not limited to, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and feedback to the policy owner.

###	Exceptions

Any exception to the policy must be approved by the [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee) in advance.
