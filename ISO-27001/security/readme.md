# Security Policy

## Introduction 

This document specifies a comprehensive set of Technology Security Policy statements and guidelines to define how information security will be applied within Opus Works (OW). 

Its purpose is to communicate management information security directives so as to ensure consistent and appropriate protection of information throughout Opus Works. It is a reference document to be used by employees, agents, contractors and any Security authorised third party organisations or customers that may utilise, manage or control Opus Works information or Information assets.


## Applicability 
This policy is applicable; 
* To all employees working within Opus Works and others working on behalf of Opus Works in a similar capacity including contractors, consultants, temporary staff, student placements etc; and 
* To all information/data, information processing/computer systems and networks (collectively known as “information assets”) owned by Opus Works, or those entrusted to Opus Works by third parties. 

## Purpose
The purpose of Information Security within Opus Works is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability (CIA) of information and systems. This is achieved by the minimisation of business risk by preventing or reducing the impact of potential security incidents. Information Security further mitigates risks by allowing information to be shared in a controlled manner that ensures the protection of information and computing assets.

CIA is defined for the purposes of this document below; 
* Confidentiality: Protection of sensitive information from unauthorised disclosure. 
* Integrity: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of information assets. 
* Availability: Ensuring that information assets and vital services are available to users whenever they are required. This policy outlines the high-level principles that must be applied to all information systems and environments. Associated documents such as standards, process and procedure documents are based upon this policy and are referenced by it. 

## Security Policy Principles 
1. Information Security is a business enabler and aligns with business goals and objectives. 
2. Information is a critical Opus Works business asset and must be protected and handled to a degree appropriate to its classification and its value to the business. 
3. Information Security controls are necessary to protect Opus Works information assets against unacceptable loss. 
4. Information Security permeates throughout the entire organisation. 
5. Information Security is a core element of corporate governance. 
6. Opus Works adheres to accepted best practices regarding Information Security Standards. 

## Goals
The goal of this Opus Works Security Policy is to ensure that: 
* Confidentiality and Integrity of Opus Works information is assured and Business requirements for the availability of Opus Works information and information systems are met. 

Achieving these goals requires that: 
* Detailed security standards, process and procedure documents are produced and maintained in order to support Opus Works business functions. 
* Clear division of responsibilities is defined. 
* All Opus Works assets are classified in order to ensure that they are adequately secured. 
* Information is protected against unauthorised access. 
* All breaches of information security, actual or suspected, are investigated and reported to the [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee). 
* Software and systems are only used for legitimate business purposes. 
* Violation and incident management procedures are maintained. 
* Regulatory and legislative requirements are met, including independent annual review of information security.
* Data protection and information security awareness is provided for all staff. 
* Appropriate business and technical risk assessments are conducted for new services or when changes are made to existing services. 

## Compliance 
The statements in this policy are mandatory unless otherwise stated. Where compliance with one or more of the policy statements or derived standards cannot be achieved, then the instance and reason for non-compliance must be justified, documented and presented to the [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee). If the appropriate system owner (SO) chooses to accept the risk for non-compliance, as determined by a Security Risk Assessment, then the exemption/deviation process must be followed. 

### Changes to Policy 
Any request for change to the policy (additions, deletions or alterations) must be submitted to the [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee) for approval or denial. Approved changes considered critical and immediate outside of the annual review may be granted and the request will be incorporated into the policy. Alternatively, an exception may be granted until the next annual review.

## Organisation of Information Security

### Management Commitment 
The management of information security within Opus Works must function within a clearly defined organisational structure. Roles and responsibilities must be defined and maintained in order to support this security organisation. By maintaining a clearly defined structure within information security, the following organisational benefits will be achieved: 
* Coherent policy definitions that are applied in all situations at all levels of the business. In achieving this, Information Security will be implemented consistently and hence more effectively. 
* Clearly defined reporting lines will ensure that escalation paths provide an effective response mechanism in the management of security incidents. 
* All staff members will have clearly defined roles with regard to maintaining the integrity and on-going effectiveness of Information Security. The Directors give overall strategic direction by approving and mandating the Opus Works Security Policy and delegates operational responsibilities for Information Security to the [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee). The [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee) review policy throughout Opus Works and ensure that suitable policies are in place to support Opus Works security principles. Management demonstrate their commitment to Information Security by: 
  * Reviewing and re-approving the policy annually. 
  * Receiving and acting appropriately on management reports concerning Information Security performance metrics and security incidents.

* All employees must be briefed about information security in general terms, using current security issues, changes, incidents or near-misses, regular appraisals, team meetings etc. as convenient opportunities to raise the subject.

### Exemption 
A system owner (SO) may propose short term exemptions to policy or standards, while an action plan to return the system to a compliant state is underway.

The SO, working with a member of the [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee), is responsible for documenting any risks arising from the proposed exemptions and specifying any mitigating controls which could be deployed to reduce the risk. The SO must document a mitigation action plan that details how their asset will become fully compliant with the policy or standard within a documented time frame. The exemption must be documented and be included in the SO risk register. The SO will be held accountable for all mitigating controls and undertaking their agreed action plan within the agreed timeframe. All exemptions must be reviewed at least every 3 months (or longer if agreed in the action plan) by the System Owner and at least 2 members of the [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee). The [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee) will maintain the list of authorised exemptions and the reasons why the exemptions exist. 

### Deviation 
A system owner (SO) may also propose a permanent deviation to policy or standards for an information asset under their remit, where no action plan exists or is being pursued to return the system to complaint state. The [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee), working with the SO, are responsible for documenting any risks arising from the proposed deviation and specifying any mitigating controls which could be deployed to reduce the risk. The deviation must be documented and be included in the System Owner Log and where appropriate, corporate risk register. The SO is responsible for any and all risks introduced to Opus Works as a result of their deviation. All Deviations must be reviewed at least every 12 months by the [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee) and the respective SO. The [ISMS Committee](../README.md#the-isms-committee) will maintain a list of authorised deviations and the reasons why the deviation exist.
