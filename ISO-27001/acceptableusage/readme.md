# Acceptable Usage Policy

## Definition

For the purposes of this document, references to "Opus Works" refers also to their Customers (whether prospect or contracted) organisations and systems.

## Overview

Opus Works intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to impose restrictions that are contrary to Opus Works' established culture of openness, trust and integrity. Opus Works is committed to protecting Opus Works employees, partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network accounts providing electronic mail, WWW browsing, and FTP, are the property of Opus Works. These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of the company, our clients and customers in the course of normal operations. 

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every Opus Works employee and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines and to conduct their activities accordingly.

## Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at Opus Works. These rules are in place to protect the employee and Opus Works. Inappropriate use exposes Opus Works to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal issues.

## Scope

This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing devices, and network resources to conduct Opus Works business or interact with internal networks and business systems, whether owned or leased by Opus Works, the employee or a third party. All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary, and other workers at Opus Works and its subsidiaries are responsible for exercising good judgement regarding appropriate use of information, electronic devices, and network resources in accordance with The Company policies and standards, and local laws and regulations. Exceptions to this policy are documented in the Policy Compliance section of this document.

This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers at Opus Works, including all personnel affiliated with third parties. This policy applies to all equipment that is owned or leased by Opus Works.

## Policy

### General Use and Ownership

Opus Works proprietary information stored on electronic and computing devices whether owned or leased by Opus Works, the employee or a third party, remains the sole property of The Company. You must ensure through legal or technical means that proprietary information is protected in accordance with the Data Protection Standard.

You have a responsibility to promptly report the theft, loss or unauthorized disclosure of Opus Works proprietary information.

You may access, use or share Opus Works proprietary information only to the extent it is authorized and necessary to fulfil your assigned job duties.

Employees are responsible for exercising good judgement regarding the reasonableness of personal use. Individual departments are responsible for creating guidelines concerning personal use of Internet/Intranet/Extranet systems. In the absence of such policies, employees should be guided by departmental policies on personal use, and if there is any uncertainty, employees should consult their Line Manager or a Director.

For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within Opus Works may monitor equipment, systems and network traffic at any time.

Opus Works reserves the right to audit networks and systems on a periodic basis to ensure compliance with this policy.

## Security and Proprietary Information

All mobile and computing devices that connect to the internal network must comply with the Acceptable Usage Policy.

System level and user level passwords must comply with the Password Policy. Providing access to another individual, either deliberately or through failure to secure its access, is prohibited.

Employees must use extreme caution when opening e-mail attachments received from unknown senders, which may contain malware.

### Unacceptable Use

The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g., systems administration staff may have a need to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting production services).

Under no circumstances is an employee of Opus Works authorized to engage in any activity that is illegal under UK, European or international law while utilising Opus Works-owned resources.
