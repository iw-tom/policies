# Data Retention, Destruction and Disposal Policy

## Overview

As an organisation Infinity Works has a responsibility to protect the integrity and confidentiality of personal data held by us with regard to our clients, employees and partners. Individual employees also have that obligation with regards to unauthorised disclosure of data whether it is oral, printed, hand-written or computer based.

## Purpose

This policy has been written to provide the necessary information to Infinity Works employees and contractors detailing their duties under the Data Protection Act 1998 and Record Retention procedures. 

This policy has also been written to set out the standards expected by Infinity Works employees and contractors in relation to processing of personal data and safeguarding individual’s rights.

The Data Protection Act 1998 has two core purposes:

1. To regulate the use by those (knows as data controllers) who obtain, hold and process personal data on living individuals.
1. To provide certain rights (for example, of accessing personal information) to those living individuals (known as data subjects) whose data is held.

## Policy

### Retention

Data and records should not be kept for longer than is necessary. This principle finds statutory form in the Data Protection Act 1998, which requires that personal data processed for any purpose "shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose".  See Data Protection Policy for more details.

Please see record retention schedule at the end of this Policy.

### Destruction and Disposal

To ensure compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998, all information, in any format, must be destroyed after the retention period from any Infinity Works location. All information, in any format held by Infinity Works, must be destroyed in a way which does not breach the confidentiality of our employees, contractors and customers.

All office paperwork for destruction should be shredded. Other paper can be disposed of in the bins provided in offices as long as it contains no sensitive or identifiable information – if in any doubt then it must be shredded.

The procedure for the destruction of Confidential or Sensitive Waste on electronic media such as USB stick, SD card, hard drives, or other removable media is:

- Destruction is agreed by the Operations Manager, ISMS Committee or Director
- The media is held by the Office
- The Office will forward the device or media to a reputable supplier for secure destruction or secure erasing (if the media or device will be given to a charity or school)

Destruction of back-up copies of such data will also be dealt with in the same manner.
