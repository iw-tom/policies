#  Business Continuity
This policy outlines how we react to external events (e.g loss of access to our offices due to a fire) in order to continue to conduct business.

# General principles
* We do not rely on the availability of our office building
   * Fallback positions are discussed with clients, and may include staff: 
      * Working from home
      * Working from client sites
      * Working from alternative locations (e.g. rented office space)
* As per our [Backup Policy](../backup/readme.md)
   * We use cloud services to remove our reliance on physical infrastructure and buildings
* As per our [Network Systems Policy](../networksystems/readme.md) and [Virus Protection Policy](../virusprotection/readme.md) we consider all networks as both inherently insecure and replaceable with any Internet connection meaning that we don't need our network to function
* Our main Staff communication channels (Slack and Google Mail) are both global in scale, independent and cloud-hosted
   * Secondary communication could be provided by telephone if required
   * We store a directory of staff contact details in our Google and Slack directories

## Event handling process
* In the case of a building evacuation, or any other event which could cause the loss of access to an office or the loss of the utility of that office (e.g. loss of Internet connection), the Office Manager will send out a message on Slack and Google Mail notifying everyone to avoid the office until further notice.
* Regular updates will be provided so that everyone knows the current situation.
* When the situation is resolved, the Office Manager will confirm the safety of the office, then communicate that it is ready for use.
