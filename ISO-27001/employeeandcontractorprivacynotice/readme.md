# Employee and Contractor Privacy Notice

## What is the purpose of this document?
>Opus Works is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information.
>This privacy notice describes how we collect and use personal information about you during and after your working relationship with us, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
>It applies to all employees and contractors.

Opus Works is a “data controller”. This means that we are responsible for deciding how we hold
and use personal information about you. We are required under data protection legislation to notify
you of the information contained in this privacy notice.

This notice applies to current and former employees and contractors. This notice does not form part
of any contract of employment or other contract to provide services. We may update this notice at
any time but if we do so, we will provide you with an updated copy of this notice as soon as
reasonably practical.

It is important that you read and retain this notice, together with any other privacy notice we may
provide on specific occasions when we are collecting or processing personal information about you,
so that you are aware of how and why we are using such information and what your rights are
under the data protection legislation.

>5. Kept only as long as necessary for the purposes we have told you about.
>6. Kept securely.

## The kind of information we hold about you

>Personal data, or personal information, means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data).

## How is your personal information collected?

We collect personal information about employees, workers and contractors through the application
and recruitment process, either directly from candidates or sometimes from an employment agency
or background check provider. We may sometimes collect additional information from third parties
including former employers, credit reference agencies or other background check agencies.

We may also collect personal information from the trustees or managers of pension arrangements
operated by the Company.

We will collect additional personal information in the course of job-related activities throughout the
period of you working for us.

## How we well use information about you

> We will only use your personal information when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use
your personal information in the following circumstances:
> 1. Where we need to perform the contract we have entered into with you.
> 2. Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.
> 3. Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests
and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
> We may also use your personal information in the following situations, which are likely to be rare:
> 1. Where we need to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests).
> 2. Where it is needed in the public interest.

**Situations in which we will use your personal information**
We need all the categories of information in the list above primarily to allow us to perform our
contract with you and to enable us to comply with legal obligations. In some cases we may use
your personal information to pursue legitimate interests of our own or those of third parties,
provided your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests. The situations in
which we will process your personal information are listed below.
- Making a decision about your recruitment or appointment.
- Determining the terms on which you work for us.
- Checking you are legally entitled to work in the UK.
- Paying you and, if you are an employee or deemed employee for tax purposes, deducting tax
and National Insurance contributions (NICs).
- Providing the following benefits to you: childcare vouchers, cycle to work scheme, private
healthcare, death in service, staff discounts.
- Enrolling you in a pension arrangement in accordance with our statutory automatic enrolment
duties.
- Liaising with the trustees or managers of a pension arrangement operated by the Company,
your pension provider and any other provider of employee benefits.
- Administering the contract we have entered into with you.

including accidents at work.

our IT policies.
- To ensure network and information security, including preventing unauthorised access to our
computer and electronic communications systems and preventing malicious software
distribution.
 To conduct data analytics studies to review and better understand employee retention and
attrition rates.
- Equal opportunities monitoring.

Some of the above grounds for processing will overlap and there may be several grounds which
justify our use of your personal information.

**If you fail to provide personal information**
If you fail to provide certain information when requested, we may not be able to perform the
contract we have entered into with you (such as paying you or providing a benefit), or we may be
prevented from complying with our legal obligations (such as to ensure the health and safety of our
workers).

**Change of purpose**
We will only use your personal information for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we
reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with
the original purpose. If we need to use your personal information for an unrelated purpose, we will
notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.

Please note that we may process your personal information without your knowledge or consent, in
compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

## How we use particularly sensitive personal information

> ”Special categories” of particularly sensitive personal information require higher levels of protection. We need to have further justification for collecting, storing and using this type of personal information. We have in place an appropriate policy document and safeguards which we are required by law to maintain when processing such data. We may process special categories of personal information in the following circumstances:
> 1. In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent.
> 2. Where we need to carry out our legal obligations or exercise rights in connection with
employment.
> 3. Where it is needed in the public interest, such as for equal opportunities monitoring.
> Less commonly, we may process this type of information where it is needed in relation to legal claims or where it is needed to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public.

**Our obligations as an employer**

We will use your particularly sensitive personal information in the following ways:
-  We will use information relating to leaves of absence, which may include sickness absence or family related leaves, to comply with employment and other laws.
- We will use information about your physical or mental health, or disability status, to ensure your health and safety in the workplace and to assess your fitness to work, to provide appropriate workplace adjustments, to monitor and manage sickness absence and to administer benefits including statutory maternity pay, statutory sick pay, and pensions.
- We will use information about your race or national or ethnic origin, religious, philosophical or moral beliefs, or your sexual life or sexual orientation, to ensure meaningful equal opportunity monitoring and reporting.

**Do we need your consent?**
We do not need your consent if we use special categories of your personal information in accordance with our written policy to carry out our legal obligations or exercise specific rights in the field of employment law. In limited circumstances, we may approach you for your written consent to allow us to process certain particularly sensitive data. If we do so, we will provide you with full details of the information that we would like and the reason we need it, so that you can carefully consider whether you wish to consent. You should be aware that it is not a condition of your contract with us that you agree to any request for consent from us.

## Information about criminal convictions

> We may only use information relating to criminal convictions where the law allows us to do so. This will usually be where such processing is necessary to carry out our obligations and provided we do so in line with our data protection policy.

> Less commonly, we may use information relating to criminal convictions where it is necessary in relation to legal claims, where it is necessary to protect your interests (or someone else’s interests) and you are not capable of giving your consent, or where you have already made the information public.

We envisage that we will hold information about criminal convictions.

Where appropriate, we will collect information about criminal convictions as part of the recruitment process or we may be notified of such information directly by you in the course of you working for us.  We will use information about criminal convictions and offences in the following ways:
- To assess your suitability for the role you are employed for;
- To assess your suitability to provide services on behalf of the Company to an End Client.

We are allowed to use your personal information in this way to carry out our obligations under law or contained in our contracts with our End Clients. We have in place an appropriate policy and safeguards which we are required by law to maintain when processing such data.

## Automated decision-making
> Automated decision-making takes place when an electronic system uses personal information to make a decision without human intervention. We are allowed to use automated decision-making in the following circumstances:
> 1. Where we have notified you of the decision and given you 21 days to request a reconsideration.
> 2. Where it is necessary to perform the contract with you and appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights.
> 3. In limited circumstances, with your explicit written consent and where appropriate measures are in place to safeguard your rights.

If we make an automated decision on the basis of any particularly sensitive personal information, we must have either your explicit written consent or it must be justified in the public interest, and we must also put in place appropriate measures to safeguard your rights.

You will not be subject to decisions that will have a significant impact on you based solely on
automated decision-making, unless we have a lawful basis for doing so and we have notified you.

## Data Sharing
> We may have to share your data with third parties, including third-party service providers and End Clients.
> We require third parties to respect the security of your data and to treat it in accordance with the law.
> We may transfer your personal information outside the EU.
> If we do, you can expect a similar degree of protection in respect of your personal information.

**Why might you share my personal information with third parties?**
We will share your personal information with third parties where required by law, where it is necessary to administer the working relationship with you or where we have another legitimate interest in doing so.

**Which third-party service providers process my personal information?**
”Third parties” includes third-party service providers (including contractors and designated agents) and other entities within our group. The following activities are carried out by third-party service providers: payroll, pension administration, benefits provision and administration.

**How secure is my information with third-party service providers?**
All our third-party service providers are required by law to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes. We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
**When will you share my information with third parties?**
We may share your personal information with other third parties, for example in the context of your work on behalf of the Company with an End Client, they will need to know certain information about the individuals working for them particularly if you are on a client site.

We may also need to share your personal information with a regulator or to otherwise comply with the law. This may include making returns to HMRC.

##Data Security
> We have put in place measures to protect the security of your information. Details of these measures are available upon request.
> Third parties will only process your personal information on our instructions and where they have agreed to treat the information confidentially and to keep it secure.

We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.

We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.

##Data Retention
**How long will you use my information for?**
We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal information so that it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to you. Once you are no longer an employee or contractor of the company we will retain and securely destroy your personal information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

##Rights of access, correction, erasure, and restriction
**Your duty to inform us of changes**

It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during your working relationship with us.

**Your rights in connection with personal information**
Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:
- Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
- Request correction of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected.
- Request erasure of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
- Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes.
- Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
- Request the transfer of your personal information to another party.

If you want to review, verify, correct or request erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a copy of your personal information to another party, please contact sar@Opusworks.com.

**No fee usually required**
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is clearly unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.

**What we may need from you**
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.

##Right to withdraw consent
In the limited circumstances where you may have provided your consent to the collection, processing and transfer of your personal information for a specific purpose, you have the right to withdraw your consent for that specific processing at any time. To withdraw your consent, please contact sar@Opusworks.com . Once we have received notification that you have withdrawn your consent, we will no longer process your information for the purpose or purposes you originally agreed to, unless we have another legitimate basis for doing so in law.

##Data Protection Officer
We have appointed a data protection officer (DPO) to oversee compliance with this privacy notice. If you have any questions about this privacy notice or how we handle your personal information, please contact the DPO. You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues.

##Changes to this privacy notice
We reserve the right to update this privacy notice at any time, and we will provide you with a new privacy notice when we make any substantial updates. We may also notify you in other ways from time to time about the processing of your personal information.

**If you have any questions about this privacy notice, please contact dataprotection@Opusworks.com.**
