# Disciplinary and Capability Policy

## Overview

It is our people that make Opus Works a great place to work. That’s why we work hard to be an inclusive employer, so everyone can be their best. We want people to enjoy coming to work at Opus Works and most of all we want them to be happy in what they do. If someone’s conduct or behaviour is unacceptable or their performance is below what we would expect, it lets the rest of the team down and we need to do something.  We’ll be consistent and fair in managing such problems at work and will treat each situation on its own merits.  We’ll explain clearly what the problem is and what we expect.  With capability issues we’ll provide support to help you improve.   This procedure applies to employees but not contractors. 

### What this means

- We’ll make sure problems with behaviour, conduct and performance are dealt with as quickly as we can
- If possible, we’ll try to resolve the problem informally at first
- If it is a capability issue, we’ll make sure you know when there is a problem with your performance. You’ll then have a chance to give your views on your performance and what should be done before any decisions are made and we’ll provide support to help you improve
- If it is a disciplinary issue, we’ll investigate allegations of issues and problems to establish the facts and we’ll tell you about any allegations against you. You’ll then have a chance to give your version of what happened before any decisions are made
- Once we’ve established the facts, we’ll decide whether we need to take informal or formal action
- If we arrange a formal meeting, you’ll be able to bring a companion if you want to
- If you’re given a formal warning or you’re dismissed, you’ll be able to appeal

### A "Manager"

Throughout this policy we will use the term "manager".  The term "manager" will mean your Line Manager or a Director.  Feedback can come from multiple parties dependent on the nature of the concern.

## Scope

This policy applies to all Opus Works Group employees & contractors.

## Policy

### Informal stage

If there’s a problem with your conduct or performance we’ll look at whether or not we can resolve it informally. 

#### Disciplinary Issues

A manager will make sure you know what the problem is and if necessary, will also suggest areas for improvement. 

Normally an informal discussion is enough to resolve the problem. However, sometimes it’s not enough so we may need to do something a bit more formal.

If we can’t resolve the problem informally, a manager will be appointed to investigate the potential issue. The investigation helps us to find out if we need to take the matter any further. We’ll carry out the investigation as quickly as we can.

#### Capability Issues

You’ll have a meeting with a manager to talk about your performance. If there’s a problem, a manager will make sure you know and work with you to set a plan to help you improve. The plan is important; it will set out what you need to do, when you need to do it by and what support and training you’ll have if you need it. 

Working with a manger on the plan is usually enough to put you back on the right track. However, sometimes it’s not enough and we may need to do something more structured to help you improve.

#### Suspension

In some cases we might need to suspend you from work on pay while we investigate an issue.  Examples of when we might need to suspend you from work are:

- It looks like there’s been an act of serious misconduct
- A crime might have been committed
- There is a risk to the health and safety of Opus Works colleagues or anyone else
- The misconduct could potentially damage our interests
- You being at work may impact on our ability to conduct the investigation.

If you’re suspended from work, we’ll write to you to confirm the situation so that you understand why and what you need to do.

### Formal Stage

If we get to this stage, you’ll be invited to a meeting. You can bring a companion from Opus Works to the meeting if you want to. Normally the meeting will be run by a manager who was not involved in the investigation. We call this person, the “Chairperson”.  

If you or your companion can’t go to the meeting you need to let the Chairperson know why as soon as possible.  If there is a good reason, we may rearrange it. On-going sickness absence may not be enough of a reason for you not to attend a meeting. If you don’t attend, the Chairperson can in some circumstances insist the meeting goes ahead and may make a decision in your absence. 

The meeting is a two-way discussion between you and the Chairperson. If it is a disciplinary issue, you’ll have an opportunity to put forward your version of what happened.  If it is a capability issue, the meeting is a chance to look again at the performance problem and share your points of view about how to solve it.   After you and the Chairperson have said everything you need to, the Chairperson might pause the meeting. This gives them time to decide what the right outcome should be based on your discussions. They might also pause the meeting at any time if they need time to do more investigation. 

We will inform you of our decision usually within a week of the hearing.  The Chairperson may decide to warn you about the problem and explain the need to improve. The types of warning are set out below. 

The levels of warning and types of dismissal are: 

1.	Stage 1 – Formal Verbal Warning

    If the complaint or offence is minor, you’ll be given a formal verbal warning.  We’ll explain what the offence or complaint is and what we’re likely to do if it happens again.   If necessary, we’ll also explain how you need to improve and by when.  We keep a copy of the warning on your file and it’s live for 6 months.  After that, if everything is ok, we’ll disregard it. 

1.	Stage 2 - First Written Warning

    If your conduct or performance (as relevant) doesn’t improve after you’ve had a verbal warning or you commit another similar offence (and there are no other active written warnings on your disciplinary record) or the misconduct or capability issue is serious enough to miss out Stage 1, you will usually receive a first written warning. We’ll explain what the offence or complaint is and what we’re likely to do it if happens again or why your performance isn’t up to standard (as relevant) and what you need to achieve to sufficiently improve your performance and by when.  We won’t just issue a warning, we’ll still make sure you know what you need to do to improve, give support, where necessary, and monitor your progress. We keep a copy of your warning on your file and it will usually remain active for 9 months. After that if everything is ok, we’ll disregard it. 

1.  Stage 3 – Final Written Warning

    In case of further misconduct or performance failures where there is an active first written warning on your record, you will usually receive a final written warning.  This may also be used without a first written warning for serious cases of misconduct or failure in performance.  We’ll explain what the offence or complaint is and that you may be dismissed if we have to take disciplinary action again in future or you fail to improve your performance.  We won’t just issue a warning, we’ll still make sure you know what you need to do to improve and by when, give support where necessary and monitor your progress. The warning will usually remain active for 12 months. After that, if everything is ok we’ll disregard it. 

1.	Stage 4 – Dismissal or other action 

    You may be dismissed:
    
    -  for further misconduct where there is an active final written warning on your record
    -  for any act of gross misconduct
    -  if your performance doesn’t improve after a previous warning
    
    Examples of gross misconduct are given below.  We may consider other sanctions short of dismissal, including demotion or redeployment to another role (where permitted by your contract) and/or extension of a final written warning with a further review period. We don’t take these decisions lightly and we hope that it never gets this far. 

If you’re dismissed we’ll confirm the decision to you in writing. You’ll be given contractual notice or a payment to make up for your contractual notice.  

For less serious cases our formal procedure normally starts with a first written warning. We then move through each stage, eventually arriving at dismissal if there isn’t enough improvement. However, we may start the process at an earlier stage or skip stages if the problem is considered serious enough.

### Gross Misconduct

Gross misconduct will most likely result in dismissal without warning, with no notice or payment in lieu of notice.  The following are examples of matters which are normally regarded as gross misconduct: 

-	Theft or fraud
-	Physical violence or bullying
-	Deliberate and serious damage to property
-	Serious misuse of the organisations property or name
-	Deliberately accessing Internet sites containing pornographic, offensive or obscene material
-	Serious insubordination
-	Unlawful discrimination or harassment
-	Bringing the organisation into serious disrepute
-	Serious incapability at work brought on by alcohol or illegal drugs
-	Causing loss, damage or injury through serious negligence
-	A serious breach of health and safety rules
-	A serious breach of confidence

This list is intended as a guide and is not exhaustive.

### Appeals

You may appeal within one week of being told of the decision of a hearing.  We need to understand why you want to appeal and what you think went wrong.  Be clear and give as much information as you can when you write to the Manager / Chairperson with your appeal.  

The appeal hearing will, where possible, be held by someone other than the person who held the original hearing.  You may bring a colleague with you to the hearing.  A HR representative and / or a Board member may also attend.

We will inform you in writing of our final decision as soon as possible, usually within one week of the appeal hearing.  There is no further right of appeal. 

### Policy Compliance

#### Compliance Measurement

The ISMS Committee will verify compliance to this policy through various methods, including but not limited to, periodic walk-throughs, video monitoring, business tool reports, internal and external audits, and feedback to the policy owner. 

### Exceptions

Any exception to the policy must be approved by the ISMS Committee in advance. 

### Non-Compliance

An employee found to have violated this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.

## Grievance Policy

We want Opus Works to be a great place to work and aim to create a positive work environment.  If you have a grievance about something or someone at Opus Works you should let us know and we’ll try to solve it as soon as we can.  Most grievances can be resolved quickly and informally though discussion with your Advocate, Account Manager, Line Manager or a Director.  However if this does not resolve the problem you may initiate the formal procedure set out here.  This procedure applies to all employees regardless of length of service. It does not apply to contractors. 

1.	Step 1: Written Grievance

    You should put your grievance in writing and submit it to your Advocate, Account Manager or a Director.  If your grievance concerns any of these parties you may submit it to the Operations Manager.  The written grievance should set out the nature of the complaint, including any relevant facts, dates and names of the individuals involved so that we can investigate it. 

1.	Step 2: Meeting 

     We will arrange a grievance meeting following receipt of your written grievance.  You should make every effort to attend.  You may bring a colleague to the meeting provided you make a reasonable request in advance and tell us the name of your colleague.  Your colleague will be allowed reasonable paid time off from duties to act as your companion.  If you or your colleague cannot attend at the time specified you should let us know as soon as possible and we will try, within reason, to agree an alternative time.  We may adjourn the meeting if we need to carry out further investigations, after which the meeting will usually be reconvened.  

     We will write to you to confirm our decision and notify you of any further action that we intend to take to resolve the grievance.  We will also advise you of your right of appeal. 

1.	Step 3: Appeals

    If the grievance has not been resolved to your satisfaction you may appeal in writing to your Advocate, Account Manager, a Director or the Operations Manager, stating your full grounds of appeal, within one week of the date on which the decision was sent or given to you. 

    We will hold an appeal meeting, normally within two weeks of receiving the appeal.  This will be dealt with impartially by a Manager who has not previously been involved in the case.  You will have a right to bring a colleague. 

    We will confirm our final decision in writing, usually within one week of the appeal hearing.  There is no further right of appeal.
